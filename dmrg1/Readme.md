Some simple examples of DMRG algorithm.

When writing the julia code shown here, I refer to code in the ITensor open-source package, 

https://itensor.github.io/ITensors.jl/dev/, 

and python code in the website, 

https://simple-dmrg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

I also refer to Mr. Min Long's code, 

https://colab.research.google.com/github/DavidGoing/DMRG/blob/main/DMRG_MPS.ipynb,

when writing the DMRG code in MPS version.
